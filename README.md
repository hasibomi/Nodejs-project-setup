# Nodejs-project-setup
It is a basic project setup of a Nodejs application in ES6. Everybody can use it.

#### Info
I am using `babel` to transpile from es6 & `jade` as template engine. View files are loaded from `views` folder. Static files are loaded from `assets` folder.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. cd `nodejs-project-setup`
3. Run `rm -rf .git`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run build` to get transpiled files from es6
6. To continue development in your project, use `npm run dev` to watch your changes.
